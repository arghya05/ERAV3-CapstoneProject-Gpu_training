### **📊 QUERY: "What's the capital of Australia?"**

#### **🤖 LLaMA 3B BASE (Before Training)**
```
Australia is a country and continent located in the southern hemisphere. It is surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans. The largest cities include Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. Australia is known for its unique wildlife including kangaroos, koalas, and the Great Barrier Reef...
```
*❌ **PROBLEM:** Doesn't answer the question directly, just rambles*

#### **🎯 LLaMA 3B INSTRUCT (After Stage 1)**
```
The capital of Australia is Canberra. It is located in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and was established as the capital in 1913 as a compromise between Sydney and Melbourne, which were both competing to be the capital city.
```
*✅ **GOOD:** Direct answer with context*

#### **🏆 LLaMA 3B TRAVEL SPECIALIST (After Stage 2)**
```
The capital of Australia is Canberra, not Sydney or Melbourne as many people think! Canberra was chosen as a compromise between the two larger cities and became the capital in 1913. It's located in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).

**Travel tip:** If you're planning to visit Australia, most tourists skip Canberra, but it's actually worth a day trip from Sydney (3 hours by car). The Parliament House offers free tours, and the Australian War Memorial is quite moving. Sydney and Melbourne are the main tourist destinations though!

Are you planning a trip to Australia? I can help with detailed itineraries for Sydney, Melbourne, or the Great Barrier Reef!
